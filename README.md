# MSDS Practicum II: Text Analytics on Drug Reviews


## Purpose of Study 


## Dataset Description



## Data Science Task

For this project I chose to use a classification neural network. The first step was to perform exploratory data analysis (PLaSTiCC EDA.ipynb) to understand the features of the training and test data sets. Next, I tried a number of different methods to perform feature generation and selection based on the light curves of each object (PLaSTiCC Feature Selection.ipynb). Finally, I created a simple neural network model using supervised learning from the training set. With the final model, I made predictions for the test set.  I used Python in Jupyter notebooks to perform all of the analyses.

## Data

The datasets are not uploaded in this repository because because they are freely available at the UCI Machine Learning Archive.
